# Milestone Review - 2026-W09

Date: 2026-02-28

## Progress

- P0 completed and validated.
- P1 completed and validated.
- P2 feature implementation completed (OCR module, RAG, i18n).

## Risks

- Production infra checks depend on real environment secrets and backup systems.
- Frontend build in this environment requires dependency installation (`next` missing).

## Blockers

- No writable permission for creating git refs with nested branch name prefix.
- No production credentials in repository for final rollout simulation.

## Next Actions

1. Execute release checklist in production-like environment.
2. Run gray release drill with real traffic.
3. Finalize v1.0 release tag.
